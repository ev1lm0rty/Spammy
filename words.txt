The
Indian
subcontinent
has
a
long
history
of
education.
The
Indian
subcontinent
was
home
to
several
advanced
civilizations.
However,
the
ancient
Indian
education
system
was
fairly
informal
in
the
sense,
there
was
a
heavy
reliance
on
‘gurukuls’
that
teachers
adept
in
some
skill
would
operate.
Hence,
the
ancient
Indian
education
system
wasn’t
organized.
